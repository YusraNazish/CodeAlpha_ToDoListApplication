Certainly! Let's break down the provided C++ code and explain each part:

## Task Manager (C++)

## Overview
This program is a simple command-line task manager written in C++. It allows users to manage tasks by adding new tasks, marking tasks as completed, and viewing the list of tasks. The program uses a Task structure to store task information.

## Code Explanation

## Task Structure
## cpp
struct Task {
    int id;
    std::string description;
    bool completed;
};

- The Task structure defines the properties of a task:
  - id: An integer representing the unique identifier for each task.
  - description: A string containing the task description.
  - completed: A boolean flag indicating whether the task is completed.

## addTask Function
## cpp
void addTask(std::vector<Task>& tasks, const std::string& description) {
    static int taskId = 1;
    tasks.push_back({taskId++, description, false});
}

- The addTask function adds a new task to the vector of tasks.
- It takes the task description as input and initializes the task's ID and completion status.
- The static int taskId ensures that each task gets a unique ID.

## markCompleted Function
## cpp
void markCompleted(std::vector<Task>& tasks, int taskId) {
    for (auto& task : tasks) {
        if (task.id == taskId) {
            task.completed = true;
            break;
        }
    }
}

- The markCompleted function marks a task as completed.
- It searches for the task with the specified taskId and updates its completion status.

## displayTasks Function
## cpp
void displayTasks(const std::vector<Task>& tasks) {
    std::cout << "Current Tasks:\n";
    for (const auto& task : tasks) {
        std::cout << "[" << task.id << "] ";
        std::cout << (task.completed ? "[X] " : "[ ] ");
        std::cout << task.description << "\n";
    }
}

- The displayTasks function prints the list of tasks.
- It shows the task ID, completion status (checked or unchecked), and task description.

### Main Function
- The main function is the entry point of the program.
- It initializes an empty vector of tasks.
- Inside a loop, it displays a menu with options:
  1. Add a new task.
  2. Mark a task as completed.
  3. View tasks.
  4. Exit the program.

## Usage
1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g. g++ -o task_manager task_manager.cpp).
2. Run the compiled executable (task_manager).
3. Follow the menu prompts to manage your tasks.
